# Identity Recognition from the Fingerprint

This project is about identity recognition from the fingerprint. I trained one Siamese CNN(Convolutional neural network) with PyTorch.

## Dataset Source
You can access the dataset source with this [link: [fingerprint-datasets]](https://github.com/robertvazan/fingerprint-datasets).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python
- PyTorch
- Google Colab

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mehdee81/Identity-recognition-from-the-fingerprint.git
   ```
2. Upload the `Finger Print ML-Dataset.zip` file to your Google Drive.

### Usage

1. Upload the models to Google Colab.
2. Run the model of your choice.
